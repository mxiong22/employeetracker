# Module 12 Challenge: Employee Tracker
## The motivation of this challenge was to create a command-line application that prompts the user with the options to view and manage all departments, roles, and employees in the user's company so that they can organize and plan their business. 
## All of the employee information are formatted in a table which are divided into the following categories: departments, roles, and employees. The user is able to customize their table by adding, updating, and deleting employees onto their formatted tables.
